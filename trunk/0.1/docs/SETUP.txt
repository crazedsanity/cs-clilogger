== FOREWORD ==

This file contains SETUP instructions.  This may not be a complete reference,
as this program is still in development.


== LIMITATIONS ==

 * The database MUST be PostgreSQL
 * The database name is hard-coded ("cli_logger")
 * the database host MUST be local
 * the password is hard-coded (must be manually changed)


== SETUP INSTRUCTIONS ==
1.) Connect to local PostgreSQL database as a superuser (i.e. postgres)
		psql -U postgres

2.) Create CLI user:
		postgres=>CREATE USER cli;

3.) Create database:
		postgres=>CREATE DATABASE cli_logger WITH OWNER cli;
		
4.) Disconnect from it and reconnect as the new user cli.

5.) Connect to that database and build the database as CLI .
		postgres=>\c cli_logger
		cli_logger=>\i docs/schema.sql

6.) Perform a test run (disconnect from the database)
		perl cli_logger.pl "" ./test.pl
		
7.) Check the inserted records seem correct (check all tables in database)
