PHP-Based Command Line Interface Logger
=================

This is a system for running scripts through a PHP wrapper on the command line of a Linux-based system (it might work on Windows, but... well, I don't do Windows; if you wanna help, let me know).  Go to the project website to learn more, the page is actually quite informative: [ http://www.crazedsanity.com/projects/cs-clilogger ].

Basically, it logs information about the script so it can be viewed from a webpage, instead of looking through logs on a server.  There's some work to be done on the interface (you know, like *making* one).
